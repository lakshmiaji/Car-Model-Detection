# Car-Model-Detection

This repository contains model for detecting car model type trained on Stanford Car Dataset using Resnet34.
 
Image classification (or Image recognition) is a subdomain of computer vision in which an algorithm looks at an image and assigns it a tag from a collection of predefined tags or categories that it has been trained on.

## Dataset
The Cars dataset contains 16,185 images of 196 classes of cars. The data is split into 8,144 training images and 8,041 testing images, where each class has been split roughly in a 50-50 split.
